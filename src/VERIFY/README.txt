This folder exists solely to host plots of the sideband
as used in the rabbitt_utilities tools - look at the 
visualised sideband to ensure it lines up with the intended
sideband interval. 

Ideally, you want from 5-10% of the peak
intensity (lower energy side) to 5-10% of the peak intensity
(higher energy side). 

The procedure will still 'work' if some of the sideband is 
missed, or if additional 'empty' space is included, but 
these will affect the physical interpretation of the 
extracted phases.
